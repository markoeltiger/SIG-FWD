One, two, turn.

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.208
Open, head up.

00:00:47.083 --> 00:00:48.083
Flex.

Shoulders down. Open.

Approach straight up. Flex.

00:01:04.708 --> 00:01:05.958
Approach straight up.

10
00:01:42.916 --> 00:01:43.916
Nine.

11
00:01:45.375 --> 00:01:47.041
Those are my girls!

12
00:01:47.125 --> 00:01:49.625
Nine. Nine point five.

13
00:01:50.583 --> 00:01:53.291
Nine. Eight point five.

14
00:01:54.291 --> 00:01:57.875
Nine. Nine point five. Eight point five.

15
00:01:57.958 --> 00:02:01.291
Divers for the next round,
please check in...

16
00:02:01.375 --> 00:02:04.375
Oh, shit! Damn, girl!

17
00:02:04.458 --> 00:02:06.791
You rock, girl!

18
00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:10.833
Very good! Go get some rest.

19
00:02:11.625 --> 00:02:12.916
Tizoc, ten!

20
00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.125
Chile, three. Carlos, check Tizoc out.

21
00:02:16.208 --> 00:02:18.375
- Come on, girls!
- Very good entry.

22
00:02:18.458 --> 00:02:20.625
- Hey, how did you feel?
- Good.

23
00:02:20.708 --> 00:02:22.708
- A bit weak.
- No, it was good.

24
00:02:22.791 --> 00:02:24.375
Don't relax, just flex.

25
00:02:24.458 --> 00:02:28.791
Tizoc Reyes, silver medalist
of the last Pan American Games.

26
00:02:29.041 --> 00:02:30.041
Ten!

27
00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:31.500
Come on, Tizoc!

28
00:02:36.875 --> 00:02:38.000
Judges?

29
00:02:38.833 --> 00:02:42.250
Seven point five, eight, seven.

30
00:02:42.333 --> 00:02:45.041
Seven point five, seven point five.

31
00:02:45.125 --> 00:02:47.125
Eight, seven point five.

32
00:02:59.125 --> 00:03:00.666
One, two.

33
00:03:03.291 --> 00:03:07.416
Let's start with women's
10m synchronized diving.

34
00:03:17.458 --> 00:03:21.125
From Mexico City,
Mariel Saenz and Alejandra Moreno.

35
00:03:22.916 --> 00:03:25.750
Forward somersault
with one-half twist in position B.

36
00:03:27.708 --> 00:03:29.208
- Ready?
- Ready.

37
00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:32.625
One, two.

38
00:03:52.041 --> 00:03:53.708
Get her out!

39
00:03:53.791 --> 00:03:55.875
Quickly!

40
00:03:55.958 --> 00:03:58.916
- Get her out!
- Doctor!

41
00:03:59.708 --> 00:04:02.375
Patient with probable spinal cord injury.

42
00:04:02.458 --> 00:04:04.416
Copy, on standby.

43
00:04:07.833 --> 00:04:09.625
AMBULANCE

44
00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:47.375
- I'm coming.
- What are you doing, Mariel?

45
00:04:47.458 --> 00:04:50.125
- Everybody's arriving now.
- I said I'm coming.

46
00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:55.916
Welcome!

47
00:04:57.125 --> 00:04:59.791
- Where's the birthday girl?
- Today is...

48
00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:11.875
- So silly!
- What did you do?

49
00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:15.541
He's swimming
the 100m butterfly in a minute...

50
00:05:15.625 --> 00:05:16.833
Hi!

51
00:05:17.833 --> 00:05:19.625
You're not silly at all!

52
00:05:19.708 --> 00:05:22.000
- Of course it has!
- Gold for gold.

53
00:05:22.083 --> 00:05:24.916
- Don't disappoint me.
- Let's see the video.

54
00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.083
Sure!

55
00:05:27.708 --> 00:05:30.250
- Hey, how's Ale doing?
- She's fine.

56
00:05:30.333 --> 00:05:31.833
What did the doctor say?

57
00:05:31.916 --> 00:05:33.541
Cut that, girl!

58
00:05:33.625 --> 00:05:35.166
Let's see the video!

59
00:05:36.666 --> 00:05:38.750
Video!

60
00:05:38.833 --> 00:05:40.500
At just 15 years old,

61
00:05:40.583 --> 00:05:45.041
Mariel Saenz already has an Olympic medal.

62
00:05:45.125 --> 00:05:46.541
No fear!

63
00:05:46.625 --> 00:05:49.250
- Mom, that's you!
- Yes, it's me, honey.

64
00:05:49.333 --> 00:05:52.041
You two are very much alike.

65
00:05:52.125 --> 00:05:55.416
A great achievement for Mexico's sport!

66
00:05:56.083 --> 00:05:58.291
And that's it!

67
00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:06.291
Mariel Saenz wins an Olympic bronze medal.

68
00:06:06.375 --> 00:06:08.541
- There's my girl!
- You were so young!

69
00:06:08.625 --> 00:06:12.958
Mariel Saenz is ready for a new challenge.

70
00:06:13.041 --> 00:06:15.958
She's a rising star for our country!

71
00:06:18.708 --> 00:06:22.083
This jump will define
Mexico's type of medal.

72
00:06:22.166 --> 00:06:25.625
- Where are you going?
- I know it by heart, mom.

73
00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:29.041
- We want the gold!
- Shut up!

74
00:06:33.541 --> 00:06:36.458
What are you doing?
It's the best part of the video.

75
00:06:36.541 --> 00:06:38.208
I know.

76
00:06:38.291 --> 00:06:40.958
- Want some?
- No. When is Ale coming back?

77
00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:46.583
She sprained her neck
and pulled her triceps.

78
00:06:46.666 --> 00:06:47.500
No.

79
00:06:47.583 --> 00:06:51.250
- She won't train for a while.
- Will she go to the FINA Cup?

80
00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:53.791
No.

81
00:06:53.875 --> 00:06:57.833
If we don't go to the FINA Cup,
we won't qualify for the Olympics!

82
00:06:57.916 --> 00:06:59.708
Calm down!

83
00:06:59.791 --> 00:07:03.958
Hey, you and Ale earned
a place in the FINA Cup

84
00:07:04.041 --> 00:07:06.291
with your victory at the Pan Am Games.

85
00:07:06.375 --> 00:07:11.500
So don't worry, the places are guaranteed.
But not necessarily for you two.

86
00:07:11.583 --> 00:07:13.291
What do you mean?

87
00:07:13.375 --> 00:07:16.875
Mariel, don't be so childish,
you're not a child.

88
00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:19.083
You know perfectly well what I mean.

89
00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:22.375
Those places don't belong
to specific people.

90
00:07:22.458 --> 00:07:25.541
Those places are for Mexico.

91
00:07:25.625 --> 00:07:27.958
The Federation decides who they're for.

92
00:07:28.041 --> 00:07:29.083
Sure, yes.

93
00:07:30.208 --> 00:07:33.541
- So?
- So you will be diving for the Cup.

94
00:07:35.375 --> 00:07:36.583
But not with Ale.

95
00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:39.083
With who?

96
00:07:41.250 --> 00:07:44.791
There's a very talented young girl
whose 10m dive is awesome.

97
00:07:44.875 --> 00:07:46.416
A girl? How old is she?

98
00:07:47.458 --> 00:07:49.291
Like you in Barcelona, 14.

99
00:07:49.375 --> 00:07:51.625
Are you kidding me? You can't compare!

100
00:07:51.708 --> 00:07:54.541
Are you the only prodigy in the world?

101
00:07:54.625 --> 00:07:58.125
These will be my last Olympics, Braulio!

102
00:07:58.208 --> 00:08:01.625
I'll be 30 in the next ones
and I won't be able to compete.

103
00:08:02.083 --> 00:08:06.416
The injury took me out of Sydney,
I lost the bronze in the last ones.

104
00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:09.500
I won't get another chance.
I don't want to ruin it

105
00:08:09.583 --> 00:08:12.541
with a girl who doesn't know
what she's doing.

106
00:08:12.625 --> 00:08:15.041
I've been coaching her for one year.

107
00:08:15.125 --> 00:08:16.250
Only one year?

108
00:08:17.333 --> 00:08:19.833
So in one year
she's learned what she needs

109
00:08:19.916 --> 00:08:22.125
to compete against the world's elite?

110
00:08:22.208 --> 00:08:25.958
If I'm telling you she can do it,
it's because she can.

111
00:08:26.041 --> 00:08:30.125
No, you just want her to get experience
and you're putting her with me

112
00:08:30.208 --> 00:08:32.041
so she can go to her first cup.

113
00:08:32.125 --> 00:08:36.291
No, honey,
I want you to put the Mexican team

114
00:08:36.375 --> 00:08:37.958
before your stupid ego.

115
00:08:38.041 --> 00:08:41.583
I don't want to look like a fool
in Athens with a dumb girl.

116
00:08:42.791 --> 00:08:45.750
- I won't compete in those conditions.
- All right.

117
00:08:47.125 --> 00:08:48.125
Don't do it.

118
00:08:49.458 --> 00:08:50.458
And that's it.

119
00:08:51.916 --> 00:08:53.083
Seriously, Braulio?

120
00:08:55.541 --> 00:08:59.250
Seriously, Mariel.
Instead of one, I'll get two.

121
00:10:22.208 --> 00:10:25.291
I'm sorry, we don't have
this kind of antibiotics.

122
00:10:27.416 --> 00:10:29.666
I can check with the other stores.

123
00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:32.208
Two bottles of Tylenol, please.

124
00:10:33.708 --> 00:10:35.875
You can pay at the cash register.

125
00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:48.666
60 pesos, please.

126
00:12:54.250 --> 00:12:56.166
Tizoc, and the rest of the team?

127
00:12:56.250 --> 00:12:58.166
In the pool.

128
00:12:58.250 --> 00:13:00.250
They want to become artists.

129
00:13:04.833 --> 00:13:06.791
As the team has to keep going,

130
00:13:06.875 --> 00:13:11.041
we've invited a very talented girl
to be Mariel's partner.

131
00:13:11.125 --> 00:13:14.625
Her name is Nadia
and she's 14, she's brilliant.

132
00:13:14.708 --> 00:13:15.708
Nadia!

133
00:13:16.583 --> 00:13:19.750
She's 14, just the same age Mariel was.

134
00:13:19.833 --> 00:13:21.291
Look, this is Pati.

135
00:13:21.375 --> 00:13:23.375
- Hi, Nadia, how are you?
- Good.

136
00:13:23.458 --> 00:13:25.541
How do you feel here?

137
00:13:25.625 --> 00:13:27.291
It feels like a dream.

138
00:14:13.416 --> 00:14:14.458
Fuck.

139
00:14:14.541 --> 00:14:17.416
- Are you okay, Mariel?
- Yes.

140
00:14:18.500 --> 00:14:20.041
Just a fucking cramp.

141
00:14:25.041 --> 00:14:28.041
It's the third urinary infection
in two months.

142
00:14:28.125 --> 00:14:30.000
Wait, I'll sterilize this.

143
00:14:31.583 --> 00:14:32.666
Let's see. Spread.

144
00:14:33.958 --> 00:14:35.083
Spread more.

145
00:14:36.125 --> 00:14:38.625
I know it hurts, but you have to trust me.

146
00:14:39.666 --> 00:14:42.208
If I don't do it now,
it'll get worse later.

147
00:14:43.416 --> 00:14:44.708
There you go.

148
00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:47.708
- Better?
- Yes.

149
00:14:47.791 --> 00:14:50.000
Okay, can you get down a bit, please?

150
00:14:54.041 --> 00:14:57.833
Don't stop taking the antibiotics
in the middle of the treatment.

151
00:14:57.916 --> 00:15:00.500
How many times have we been through this?

152
00:15:00.583 --> 00:15:02.958
How come you keep getting in trouble?

153
00:15:03.041 --> 00:15:06.958
If the infection affects your kidneys,
it'll get complicated.

154
00:15:07.041 --> 00:15:11.458
What you're doing is dangerous,
you can cause antibiotic resistance...

155
00:15:22.833 --> 00:15:24.041
Hey, girl!

156
00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:27.791
I'm sorry, I'm running late!

157
00:15:29.541 --> 00:15:30.791
Mariel!

158
00:15:31.875 --> 00:15:35.333
Wait up! Give me two minutes, just that!

159
00:15:36.250 --> 00:15:37.541
I'm running late!

160
00:15:37.625 --> 00:15:40.458
I know, but I won't delay you.
Two minutes.

161
00:15:42.333 --> 00:15:43.666
- Girl!
- Okay.

162
00:15:44.708 --> 00:15:46.125
Let's stop arguing.

163
00:15:47.208 --> 00:15:48.541
The truth is that I...

164
00:15:50.250 --> 00:15:52.125
I'm not a golden coin

165
00:15:52.208 --> 00:15:54.125
Braulio.

166
00:15:55.708 --> 00:15:59.041
To be of everyone's liking

167
00:16:00.125 --> 00:16:02.625
I was born like this and this is how I am

168
00:16:02.708 --> 00:16:06.500
If they don't like me, whatever!

169
00:16:06.583 --> 00:16:08.375
Shut up!

170
00:16:10.041 --> 00:16:11.541
Please!

171
00:16:11.625 --> 00:16:14.750
- Damn, girl!
- You're so ridiculous.

172
00:16:14.833 --> 00:16:15.958
Damn, girl!

173
00:16:17.083 --> 00:16:18.083
Look.

174
00:16:27.375 --> 00:16:28.541
Happy birthday.

175
00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:36.291
I didn't give it to you at the party
because you were crazy.

176
00:16:36.375 --> 00:16:37.416
Will you wear it?

177
00:16:41.083 --> 00:16:42.833
It's a gold nugget.

178
00:16:49.750 --> 00:16:51.458
You and me are a team, girl.

179
00:16:53.916 --> 00:16:56.208
I would never do anything to hurt you.

180
00:17:00.291 --> 00:17:01.958
If I expect too much of you,

181
00:17:03.083 --> 00:17:05.375
it's because you can do that and more.

182
00:17:08.583 --> 00:17:10.791
Together against the world. Right?

183
00:17:10.875 --> 00:17:11.875
Right.

184
00:17:49.750 --> 00:17:50.750
What?

185
00:18:02.875 --> 00:18:05.250
Mom, why didn't you wake me up?

186
00:18:05.333 --> 00:18:07.416
They canceled the training session.

187
00:18:08.541 --> 00:18:10.791
What do you mean they cancelled it?

188
00:18:10.875 --> 00:18:13.041
There's a crazy woman making a fuss.

189
00:18:14.250 --> 00:18:15.250
What?

190
00:18:15.875 --> 00:18:18.833
She says Braulio did
things he shouldn't have.

191
00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:29.291
Seriously, I'm sorry.
This is not a good time...

192
00:18:29.375 --> 00:18:31.833
What's happening with the tournaments?

193
00:18:31.916 --> 00:18:34.875
In two weeks,
my daughter is going to Tijuana.

194
00:18:34.958 --> 00:18:40.458
Seriously, I'm sorry. I apologize.
I'll let you know as soon as I can.

195
00:18:40.541 --> 00:18:43.791
Who knows? We need to know.

196
00:18:45.791 --> 00:18:49.500
- What's happening?
- They suspended Braulio.

197
00:18:49.583 --> 00:18:50.583
Why?

198
00:18:53.166 --> 00:18:56.250
He's been accused of sexual abuse.

199
00:19:03.083 --> 00:19:04.083
Mariel!

200
00:19:05.666 --> 00:19:06.916
Mariel, are you okay?

201
00:19:11.208 --> 00:19:12.583
Approach straight up.

202
00:19:14.166 --> 00:19:15.166
Flex.

203
00:19:20.333 --> 00:19:23.916
One, two. Look for the angle.

204
00:20:30.166 --> 00:20:31.916
No way, it's not fair.

205
00:20:33.166 --> 00:20:38.250
If they accuse you of anything,
you don't have any rights,

206
00:20:38.333 --> 00:20:41.458
you don't even have
the benefit of the doubt.

207
00:20:42.916 --> 00:20:46.750
That bitch fucked me up! She fucked me up!

208
00:20:49.458 --> 00:20:52.166
Girl, don't leave, please.

209
00:20:58.291 --> 00:21:01.291
I need help.
I don't know what to do or where to go.

210
00:21:01.375 --> 00:21:04.458
You know this will always be your home.

211
00:21:05.666 --> 00:21:08.875
Thank you. I went to the Olympic Center.

212
00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:13.666
They slammed the door in my face
and treated me like a leper.

213
00:21:13.750 --> 00:21:18.541
I have a close relationship
with all the kids.

214
00:21:19.041 --> 00:21:21.291
Of course, how could it be different?

215
00:21:21.375 --> 00:21:25.083
They live there,
and most parents live outside the city.

216
00:21:25.166 --> 00:21:28.375
We take care of them, we see them grow,

217
00:21:29.583 --> 00:21:33.250
we nurse them when they get hurt or sick.

218
00:21:33.333 --> 00:21:35.291
We know them better than anyone.

219
00:21:37.041 --> 00:21:38.250
And you know, girl,

220
00:21:39.083 --> 00:21:42.041
sports get the best out of you,
but also the worst.

221
00:21:42.958 --> 00:21:45.291
And if we as coaches ignore that,

222
00:21:45.375 --> 00:21:49.500
if we could not accept them as they are,
with all that they are...

223
00:21:50.875 --> 00:21:52.708
But for them to say that I'm...

224
00:21:54.625 --> 00:21:57.541
I have a daughter, for goodness' sake!

225
00:21:58.791 --> 00:22:03.250
How can they believe
I'm capable of doing such a thing?

226
00:22:03.333 --> 00:22:06.291
- Nobody believes that.
- Yes, they do.

227
00:22:07.166 --> 00:22:08.791
You saw it, Mariel.

228
00:22:08.875 --> 00:22:12.458
Precisely on the day
that I get Nadia to join the main team,

229
00:22:13.208 --> 00:22:15.291
her crazy mother makes a scandal.

230
00:22:15.375 --> 00:22:16.375
Why?

231
00:22:17.583 --> 00:22:19.833
Because she doesn't want her to leave!

232
00:22:19.916 --> 00:22:22.083
Because her husband left her years ago,

233
00:22:22.166 --> 00:22:25.541
and if her daughter leaves too,
she'd be all alone.

234
00:22:25.625 --> 00:22:28.125
It's unfair to fuck
someone over like this,

235
00:22:28.208 --> 00:22:29.875
to take everything away,

236
00:22:29.958 --> 00:22:32.625
just because you can't stand
to see her happy.

237
00:22:34.333 --> 00:22:36.750
I'm not the kind of person they say I am.

238
00:22:39.666 --> 00:22:42.083
I'm not the kind of person they say I am.

239
00:22:45.125 --> 00:22:46.125
Girl...

240
00:22:48.041 --> 00:22:49.583
Tell me you know that.

241
00:22:50.708 --> 00:22:51.875
Braulio,

242
00:22:53.250 --> 00:22:55.875
you're the best man
I've ever met in my life.

243
00:22:57.208 --> 00:22:59.791
Tomorrow I'll go talk to the Federation.

244
00:23:00.791 --> 00:23:03.666
She can't ruin
the reputation of a man like you

245
00:23:03.750 --> 00:23:06.375
just because she doesn't know
what she wants.

246
00:23:06.458 --> 00:23:10.083
What if you talk to her?
You know Braulio better than anyone.

247
00:23:10.166 --> 00:23:13.916
Tell her what kind of man he is
and all he has done for you.

248
00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:15.375
Analia is right.

249
00:23:16.583 --> 00:23:19.541
Maybe then she'll realize
the damage she's causing.

250
00:23:51.625 --> 00:23:53.750
She's a diver because of you.

251
00:23:54.958 --> 00:23:56.208
Really?

252
00:23:56.291 --> 00:23:59.000
She must have been eight when she saw you

253
00:23:59.083 --> 00:24:01.875
for the first time on a TV show
and, since then,

254
00:24:01.958 --> 00:24:04.083
she never got off the springboard.

255
00:24:06.750 --> 00:24:09.750
- So, why are you here?
- I came to see how Nadia is.

256
00:24:11.500 --> 00:24:12.833
Nadia is angry.

257
00:24:14.125 --> 00:24:16.750
Up until recently,
it didn't matter how badly

258
00:24:16.833 --> 00:24:20.916
she wanted to be an adult
or independent or things like that.

259
00:24:22.166 --> 00:24:26.041
There was always a moment
when she was a child again.

260
00:24:28.125 --> 00:24:29.750
But then, one day,

261
00:24:32.291 --> 00:24:34.458
my little girl wasn't there anymore.

262
00:24:38.375 --> 00:24:39.375
It's just that

263
00:24:40.666 --> 00:24:45.125
the moment when she indulged herself
in being a child is gone.

264
00:24:48.250 --> 00:24:49.833
And instead,

265
00:24:52.125 --> 00:24:53.708
something obscure arose.

266
00:24:54.875 --> 00:24:55.875
A void.

267
00:24:56.541 --> 00:24:59.375
Are you sure
that something really happened?

268
00:24:59.458 --> 00:25:01.833
I am sure my daughter is not the same.

269
00:25:05.458 --> 00:25:08.625
We're going to the Olympics.

270
00:25:08.708 --> 00:25:11.791
There's nothing ordinary about that.

271
00:25:11.875 --> 00:25:15.250
And Braulio

272
00:25:15.333 --> 00:25:20.666
has to teach Nadia and me how to control

273
00:25:20.750 --> 00:25:23.125
our minds and bodies.

274
00:25:23.208 --> 00:25:25.583
And he's the best in doing so.

275
00:25:25.666 --> 00:25:29.041
He's been training
the country's best divers for 20 years.

276
00:25:30.666 --> 00:25:31.833
But for that,

277
00:25:31.916 --> 00:25:35.041
it's necessary to build trust

278
00:25:35.125 --> 00:25:38.208
and to be close to the team members

279
00:25:39.208 --> 00:25:41.000
and that may be misconstrued.

280
00:25:41.083 --> 00:25:43.000
Yes, but there must be limits,

281
00:25:43.083 --> 00:25:46.208
and no one has the right to cross them.

282
00:25:46.291 --> 00:25:50.291
Braulio doesn't cross them.
Don't confuse your fears with the truth.

283
00:25:51.333 --> 00:25:55.125
You could ruin her life
and maybe that of a man

284
00:25:56.791 --> 00:25:59.625
who wants Nadia
to develop to her full potential.

285
00:26:01.375 --> 00:26:02.875
She's not the only one.

286
00:26:04.166 --> 00:26:05.791
There were more complaints.

287
00:26:05.875 --> 00:26:07.083
Who else complained?

288
00:26:08.333 --> 00:26:10.625
They're from a few years ago.

289
00:26:12.208 --> 00:26:15.875
Well, I've been
training with Braulio for 15 years

290
00:26:17.291 --> 00:26:20.416
and never heard of anything,
so that can't be true.

291
00:26:24.208 --> 00:26:25.541
Has that man ever done

292
00:26:27.291 --> 00:26:30.208
anything to make you feel uncomfortable?

293
00:26:30.291 --> 00:26:31.958
- No.
- No?

294
00:26:33.833 --> 00:26:34.958
Braulio saw me.

295
00:26:37.291 --> 00:26:41.250
When all adults were minding
their own business,

296
00:26:41.333 --> 00:26:42.333
he saw me.

297
00:26:43.958 --> 00:26:46.916
Without him, I would be
nothing more than...

298
00:26:49.291 --> 00:26:51.000
a broken person.

299
00:26:52.750 --> 00:26:54.666
I was everything he dreamed of.

300
00:26:55.416 --> 00:26:57.916
He's in love
with everything we can create.

301
00:26:58.000 --> 00:26:59.791
That's why he cares about her.

302
00:27:02.333 --> 00:27:05.625
He wouldn't have spoken
to her if he didn't think so.

303
00:27:06.500 --> 00:27:08.833
Don't take away your daughter's chance

304
00:27:08.916 --> 00:27:11.500
of working with someone
who really sees her.

305
00:27:15.416 --> 00:27:19.875
The Olympic Committee
has already started an investigation.

306
00:27:20.750 --> 00:27:23.875
If they confirm that everything's okay,

307
00:27:25.041 --> 00:27:27.083
I won't get in my daughter's way.

308
00:27:29.500 --> 00:27:32.666
But I need to be sure
that my daughter is safe.

309
00:27:32.750 --> 00:27:33.750
Do you get me?

310
00:27:40.458 --> 00:27:41.833
Thanks for stopping by.

311
00:27:44.583 --> 00:27:48.041
Your daughter can make it
to the Olympics this year.

312
00:27:48.125 --> 00:27:51.500
Not many people have
that chance at Nadia's age.

313
00:27:52.333 --> 00:27:54.250
She can't do it without Braulio.

314
00:27:55.250 --> 00:27:57.166
I can't make it without Braulio.

315
00:27:58.333 --> 00:28:00.583
Please, think about what you're doing.

316
00:28:21.250 --> 00:28:23.958
Come on. One, two, three.

317
00:28:26.750 --> 00:28:30.875
Focus, Nadia. You know.
More control in take-off and stop.

318
00:28:32.416 --> 00:28:34.000
That's enough. That's it.

319
00:28:34.083 --> 00:28:38.291
- Come on, once again.
- No, Nadia. That's enough.

320
00:28:39.125 --> 00:28:42.208
- Again.
- One, two, three. Arms.

321
00:28:57.958 --> 00:28:59.416
One, two.

322
00:29:03.750 --> 00:29:07.125
Stiff. Up. Face. Then in, okay?

323
00:29:07.208 --> 00:29:08.875
One, two.

324
00:29:21.041 --> 00:29:23.791
- Ready?
- Focus, Nadia!

325
00:29:25.250 --> 00:29:27.166
- Braulio.
- Easy.

326
00:29:27.250 --> 00:29:28.750
Nadia!

327
00:29:30.791 --> 00:29:33.291
- What are you doing here, Braulio?
- Watching.

328
00:29:33.375 --> 00:29:35.458
They told me not to go to the pool,

329
00:29:35.541 --> 00:29:38.041
- but didn't mention the seats.
- Let's work.

330
00:29:40.208 --> 00:29:43.333
I'm sorry, Braulio,
I swear it wasn't me. I swear.

331
00:29:44.041 --> 00:29:45.375
Go to the springboard.

332
00:29:46.333 --> 00:29:50.500
You have to believe me. I told her
not to come and she didn't listen.

333
00:29:51.208 --> 00:29:52.791
I have nothing to say.

334
00:29:52.875 --> 00:29:55.875
- Braulio, look at me!
- Don't touch me.

335
00:29:55.958 --> 00:29:58.250
- Braulio, please.
- Let go.

336
00:29:58.333 --> 00:30:00.583
It wasn't me!

337
00:30:00.666 --> 00:30:03.958
Nadia, get off me!
What's with you? Are you crazy?

338
00:30:05.166 --> 00:30:07.833
Are you sick? Are you trying to tease me?

339
00:30:08.708 --> 00:30:09.916
Get out of here!

340
00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:11.625
Go to work! Get out!

341
00:30:12.583 --> 00:30:16.041
- Springboard work! Get out!
- Braulio, outside.

342
00:30:16.666 --> 00:30:19.291
This is my pool, Gerardo.
I built this place.

343
00:30:19.375 --> 00:30:23.041
I know, my friend. Let's go to my office.
Come with me, please.

344
00:30:23.125 --> 00:30:25.125
You can't treat me like this!

345
00:30:25.208 --> 00:30:27.208
- Come on.
- My team needs me!

346
00:30:27.291 --> 00:30:31.041
It's not fair
that a fucking kid ruins everything!

347
00:30:31.125 --> 00:30:33.125
It's not just about my reputation!

348
00:30:33.208 --> 00:30:36.125
I'm talking
about the upcoming Olympic Games!

349
00:30:36.208 --> 00:30:40.000
Mariel, your last Olympics
will get fucked up

350
00:30:40.083 --> 00:30:43.250
because of that fucking liar!

351
00:30:43.875 --> 00:30:46.166
That's not fair! Not fair!

352
00:30:56.291 --> 00:30:58.166
Do you like tomato sauce?

353
00:30:58.250 --> 00:31:01.916
I can make one with olive oil and salt.

354
00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:05.916
My mom makes it in advance,
because after the training sessions,

355
00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:08.708
I'm starving and I could eat a horse.

356
00:31:08.791 --> 00:31:11.833
Would you like tomato sauce
or olive oil and salt?

357
00:31:11.916 --> 00:31:15.208
I think you'll like the olive oil better.

358
00:31:15.291 --> 00:31:16.583
Whatever you like.

359
00:31:18.583 --> 00:31:21.375
- Let's go eat in my room, it's better.
- Okay.

360
00:31:22.125 --> 00:31:25.083
- I hope you like the pasta.
- It looks yummy.

361
00:31:25.958 --> 00:31:27.125
Come on in.

362
00:31:33.041 --> 00:31:34.458
Come on in, sit down.

363
00:31:37.750 --> 00:31:40.291
Wow, I didn't know we had already met.

364
00:31:40.375 --> 00:31:42.291
You have articles from when I...

365
00:31:42.375 --> 00:31:44.875
You were 12. Those...

366
00:31:48.125 --> 00:31:51.875
I'm so stupid, I fucked up again.

367
00:31:51.958 --> 00:31:54.583
- Easy.
- No, I'm so stupid.

368
00:31:54.666 --> 00:31:56.583
No, it's my fault.

369
00:31:56.666 --> 00:32:00.708
I'll help you. Easy.
Everything will be okay. What's wrong?

370
00:32:00.791 --> 00:32:02.208
It's fine.

371
00:32:02.291 --> 00:32:03.833
No, nothing is okay.

372
00:32:04.625 --> 00:32:08.708
What? Everything will be okay.
What's happening? Let me help you.

373
00:32:09.291 --> 00:32:10.791
It was my fault.

374
00:32:10.875 --> 00:32:12.125
What was your fault?

375
00:32:12.208 --> 00:32:15.375
- Everything was my fault.
- What are you talking about?

376
00:32:17.375 --> 00:32:21.666
I wrote some stuff, all bullshit
that was not meant to be read

377
00:32:21.750 --> 00:32:23.375
by anyone, not even my mom.

378
00:32:23.458 --> 00:32:26.000
- What did you write?
- It doesn't matter.

379
00:32:26.083 --> 00:32:29.500
Tell me what you wrote.
I won't tell anybody. Tell me.

380
00:32:29.583 --> 00:32:32.541
Things that didn't happen,
things I imagined.

381
00:32:32.625 --> 00:32:35.625
- It's all my fault...
- Nadia, honey!

382
00:32:36.416 --> 00:32:37.416
I'm home!

383
00:32:40.083 --> 00:32:41.375
Are you okay?

384
00:32:41.958 --> 00:32:44.083
Who gave you permission to enter?

385
00:32:44.166 --> 00:32:47.333
Don't treat me like that.
Mariel, it's late.

386
00:32:47.416 --> 00:32:48.416
Yes.

387
00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:52.083
- What happened?
- Why do you always ruin everything?

388
00:32:52.166 --> 00:32:54.958
- Honey, please!
- Get out of my room!

389
00:33:33.541 --> 00:33:37.416
- Come on, Poncho, don't be mean.
- It's not allowed.

390
00:33:37.500 --> 00:33:40.250
You know no visits are allowed
after 10:00 p.m.

391
00:33:41.583 --> 00:33:45.375
I'm not a visitor, I'm family.
How long have we known each other?

392
00:33:46.583 --> 00:33:49.500
Yes, right?
It's been many years, Ms. Mariel.

393
00:33:49.583 --> 00:33:53.125
- Come in.
- That's all, Poncho. Thank you!

394
00:34:18.083 --> 00:34:19.750
It's true.

395
00:34:19.833 --> 00:34:24.791
You don't see it,
but the last thing you said,

396
00:34:24.875 --> 00:34:26.375
"For Mexico!"

397
00:34:26.458 --> 00:34:30.166
- What else was I supposed to say?
- "We'll thrive and succeed!"

398
00:34:30.250 --> 00:34:33.250
- What else was I supposed to say?
- No, it's okay.

399
00:34:33.333 --> 00:34:36.125
- Imagine...
- "To my coaches"?

400
00:34:36.208 --> 00:34:39.708
- Sure!
- "To Carlos"?

401
00:34:39.791 --> 00:34:43.875
Yes, well, I don't know!

402
00:34:43.958 --> 00:34:45.166
Let's hear you.

403
00:34:45.250 --> 00:34:49.958
"Sir, could you explain to us
what makes you a good coach?"

404
00:34:50.833 --> 00:34:53.583
- Yes.
- The cameras are on.

405
00:34:53.666 --> 00:34:55.458
All the world is watching you.

406
00:34:57.666 --> 00:34:58.875
Here I go.

407
00:35:02.250 --> 00:35:03.291
Mariel...

408
00:35:05.208 --> 00:35:08.666
What are you doing here?
That's what I'd like to know.

409
00:35:12.583 --> 00:35:14.833
I'm going to ruin everything, Carlos.

410
00:35:18.916 --> 00:35:22.375
I'm gonna fuck it up
and I'll lose the medal again.

411
00:35:22.458 --> 00:35:27.375
No, Mariel. What do you mean by "again"?

412
00:35:28.333 --> 00:35:30.125
Forget it, I'm too drunk.

413
00:35:30.208 --> 00:35:35.291
No, Mariel. What do you mean by that?

414
00:35:35.375 --> 00:35:37.875
When did you fuck it up? You never do.

415
00:35:37.958 --> 00:35:40.208
- Yes, I do.
- No.

416
00:35:41.291 --> 00:35:43.083
- No.
- Wanna see?

417
00:35:43.166 --> 00:35:45.291
- Mariel.
- Want to see?

418
00:35:45.375 --> 00:35:46.875
Mariel, what will you do?

419
00:35:48.916 --> 00:35:51.500
Come, I'll show you
how I always fuck it up.

420
00:35:56.583 --> 00:35:59.000
- Wanna see?
- What are you doing?

421
00:36:04.833 --> 00:36:08.791
- It's stronger than me.
- What are you doing?

422
00:36:09.541 --> 00:36:11.416
Don't worry,

423
00:36:11.500 --> 00:36:14.916
Poncho is a bit deaf, he won't hear us.

424
00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:17.208
So what?

425
00:36:17.291 --> 00:36:18.875
Do you remember Tampico?

426
00:36:18.958 --> 00:36:22.541
That doesn't have anything
to do with this.

427
00:36:22.625 --> 00:36:24.375
Come here!

428
00:36:24.500 --> 00:36:27.833
Stop. See? You're too drunk.

429
00:36:27.916 --> 00:36:31.208
- I'm not drunk.
- What?

430
00:36:33.791 --> 00:36:35.291
You have to be careful.

431
00:36:37.083 --> 00:36:39.041
Mariel, what are you doing?

432
00:36:39.125 --> 00:36:41.625
Let's go, please!

433
00:36:41.750 --> 00:36:44.291
Mariel, please, let's go.

434
00:36:44.375 --> 00:36:47.208
- Let's go!
- No. What happened?

435
00:36:47.291 --> 00:36:50.291
What happened is that we're too drunk.

436
00:36:50.375 --> 00:36:53.041
Wait up, come here.

437
00:36:53.125 --> 00:36:54.791
Don't be a pussy, come here.

438
00:36:59.041 --> 00:37:00.333
Fuck!

439
00:37:04.750 --> 00:37:06.666
Mariel, let's go.

440
00:37:08.166 --> 00:37:11.291
- Mariel, this isn't funny. Let's go!
- Okay.

441
00:37:11.375 --> 00:37:13.041
Let's go!

442
00:37:14.625 --> 00:37:16.583
Come, help me.

443
00:37:16.666 --> 00:37:18.000
Yes, let's go!

444
00:37:19.208 --> 00:37:20.791
No, Mariel!

445
00:37:24.625 --> 00:37:25.791
Are you crazy?

446
00:37:27.250 --> 00:37:28.416
This is not right!

447
00:37:30.083 --> 00:37:31.416
Are you crazy, Mariel?

448
00:38:14.541 --> 00:38:16.625
Like this.

449
00:38:48.666 --> 00:38:49.791
Okay.

450
00:38:50.375 --> 00:38:51.958
Who's there?

451
00:39:07.500 --> 00:39:09.333
You've got to be kidding me!

452
00:39:14.500 --> 00:39:15.541
Come.

453
00:39:16.708 --> 00:39:17.708
Carlos.

454
00:39:51.916 --> 00:39:54.250
Where are you? Here you are. Let's see.

455
00:39:57.416 --> 00:39:59.166
Let's see. Here you are.

456
00:39:59.250 --> 00:40:01.708
Mariel, what are we going to do with you?

457
00:40:03.458 --> 00:40:07.500
- Can you give me something stronger?
- Not so close to the games.

458
00:40:07.583 --> 00:40:09.541
You already know that.

459
00:40:10.791 --> 00:40:11.916
Come in.

460
00:40:12.541 --> 00:40:14.375
- They are starting.
- Coming.

461
00:40:14.458 --> 00:40:16.583
- You can't go like this.
- I'm okay.

462
00:40:26.291 --> 00:40:27.625
It's about to start.

463
00:40:44.875 --> 00:40:47.250
- And the rest?
- They didn't dare to come.

464
00:40:47.916 --> 00:40:49.791
- Sure?
- Sure.

465
00:40:51.583 --> 00:40:52.625
I'm sorry.

466
00:40:53.708 --> 00:40:57.250
We are about to start. Please, be seated.

467
00:40:57.333 --> 00:40:58.833
Good morning, everyone.

468
00:40:59.666 --> 00:41:01.250
Thank you for being here.

469
00:41:01.333 --> 00:41:04.833
I appreciate the assistance
of so many important athletes.

470
00:41:05.541 --> 00:41:11.250
I know you've made
a great effort to be here,

471
00:41:11.333 --> 00:41:14.875
so we'll start this trial

472
00:41:14.958 --> 00:41:17.250
to investigate Nadia Alfaro's case.

473
00:41:17.333 --> 00:41:19.125
Excuse me, Mr. Vice President,

474
00:41:19.208 --> 00:41:22.625
the ones who were going
to testify haven't arrived yet.

475
00:41:22.708 --> 00:41:24.416
Could we wait for them?

476
00:41:24.500 --> 00:41:27.250
Mrs. Rivas,
we've been waiting for 40 minutes.

477
00:41:28.250 --> 00:41:31.166
If they had wished to come,
they would've arrived.

478
00:41:31.250 --> 00:41:34.291
The process should be fair for everyone.

479
00:41:34.375 --> 00:41:37.541
Mr. Peralta brought
all his people to testify.

480
00:41:37.625 --> 00:41:42.625
No, excuse me, they are not "his people,"
they are his colleagues.

481
00:41:42.708 --> 00:41:46.125
They are the most respected athletes
in this field,

482
00:41:46.208 --> 00:41:51.916
and they came here to talk
about their experience with their coach.

483
00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:56.333
I think your suggestion
that they or the Federation commit

484
00:41:56.416 --> 00:41:58.916
objectionable acts is inappropriate.

485
00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:00.583
I don't suggest anything,

486
00:42:00.666 --> 00:42:04.166
I just ask you to be fair.

487
00:42:04.250 --> 00:42:07.125
- I don't want to do this.
- Let me do the talking.

488
00:42:07.208 --> 00:42:10.375
- May I speak?
- Of course, say what you need.

489
00:42:10.458 --> 00:42:13.416
Nothing what my mom is saying is true.

490
00:42:13.500 --> 00:42:16.750
Honey, don't do this. That is not true.

491
00:42:16.833 --> 00:42:19.708
She wants us to move back
with my grandparents.

492
00:42:19.791 --> 00:42:20.958
That's the reason.

493
00:42:21.041 --> 00:42:22.291
Honey, don't do this.

494
00:42:22.375 --> 00:42:26.250
Mrs. Rivas, you have already spoken.
Now is Nadia's turn.

495
00:42:26.333 --> 00:42:29.416
Nadia is a minor,
and she can't speak for herself.

496
00:42:29.500 --> 00:42:32.041
Of course I can speak by myself.

497
00:42:33.916 --> 00:42:34.916
Speak.

498
00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:36.625
Everything is a lie.

499
00:42:36.708 --> 00:42:37.833
Let's go home.

500
00:42:38.416 --> 00:42:42.416
All the horrible things she says
about Braulio aren't true.

501
00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:47.708
Just because my life is better than hers.

502
00:42:49.250 --> 00:42:51.625
I want to be here, I want to live here.

503
00:42:51.708 --> 00:42:53.625
You are my real family.

504
00:42:53.708 --> 00:42:58.791
Mrs. Rivas, clearly, something
in your home isn't right.

505
00:42:59.250 --> 00:43:03.166
I think you should take care
of what's happening inside your family

506
00:43:03.250 --> 00:43:05.708
before making accusations outside of it.

507
00:43:05.791 --> 00:43:10.541
The Olympic Center is a safe place.
It always has been for all athletes.

508
00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:14.833
Mr. Peralta is one
of the most respected members.

509
00:43:14.916 --> 00:43:20.458
And up until now, we never heard anything
so as to continue with his suspension.

510
00:43:21.375 --> 00:43:24.875
No one has testified,
not even your own daughter.

511
00:43:27.125 --> 00:43:29.375
Our community is appalled.

512
00:43:30.333 --> 00:43:32.458
These are very delicate moments.

513
00:43:32.541 --> 00:43:35.958
We are just a few weeks away
from the Olympic Games,

514
00:43:36.041 --> 00:43:40.250
and we can't risk our team's performance

515
00:43:40.333 --> 00:43:42.791
due to an athlete's personal problems.

516
00:43:43.416 --> 00:43:45.916
- You can't do this.
- Mrs. Rivas, please.

517
00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:48.208
- You don't...
- Don't do this to me!

518
00:43:48.291 --> 00:43:50.416
- Stop it!
- Baby, tell them the truth.

519
00:43:50.500 --> 00:43:53.916
Let go off me!
If you won't listen, I'll talk to my dad.

520
00:43:56.333 --> 00:43:57.333
Nadia!

521
00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:00.000
Nadia!

522
00:44:00.958 --> 00:44:01.958
Nadia!

523
00:44:08.666 --> 00:44:10.958
Put this there, kiddo.

524
00:44:11.041 --> 00:44:13.125
- You'll drop it and you'll see.
- No.

525
00:44:13.208 --> 00:44:15.125
Your mom will get angry.

526
00:44:15.208 --> 00:44:17.791
You'll drop them!

527
00:44:17.875 --> 00:44:19.833
That's missing.

528
00:44:19.916 --> 00:44:23.166
- I have extra silverware.
- Just put them in the drawer.

529
00:44:23.250 --> 00:44:26.083
- Like this?
- Yes.

530
00:44:26.166 --> 00:44:28.458
Put some here and here.

531
00:44:30.583 --> 00:44:32.958
- The doorbell.
- Like this.

532
00:44:34.083 --> 00:44:36.750
- They are here.
- Thank you, my friend.

533
00:44:36.833 --> 00:44:39.875
Honestly, thank you very much.

534
00:44:41.833 --> 00:44:43.541
Welcome!

535
00:44:43.625 --> 00:44:46.250
- Hey, beautiful!
- Hi!

536
00:44:46.333 --> 00:44:49.208
How are you?
There's exquisite food tonight.

537
00:44:50.125 --> 00:44:52.583
We're so glad you came.

538
00:44:52.666 --> 00:44:55.000
You look so good today!

539
00:44:55.083 --> 00:44:56.083
Girl.

540
00:44:56.833 --> 00:44:59.333
And on top of it, I love Greek food!

541
00:44:59.416 --> 00:45:01.208
Come on!

542
00:45:01.291 --> 00:45:04.083
Let's go to Greece, then.

543
00:45:04.166 --> 00:45:05.875
Let's go to Greece, right?

544
00:45:05.958 --> 00:45:07.833
Yes, let's go.

545
00:45:07.916 --> 00:45:10.083
For Mariel's games. She'll win gold.

546
00:45:10.166 --> 00:45:12.791
No, honey, I have to work.

547
00:45:12.875 --> 00:45:15.500
You always have to work. No, we are going.

548
00:45:15.583 --> 00:45:19.875
I'm a simple man, I don't need anything.

549
00:45:19.958 --> 00:45:23.041
Girl, I'm a simple man, right?

550
00:45:23.916 --> 00:45:26.125
- If you say so.
- No, seriously.

551
00:45:26.208 --> 00:45:28.375
No, I don't need anything.

552
00:45:28.458 --> 00:45:31.458
I just need a reason
to wake up in the morning,

553
00:45:31.541 --> 00:45:34.291
a job to come back home and rest,

554
00:45:34.375 --> 00:45:36.166
and a family that supports me.

555
00:45:36.250 --> 00:45:37.833
That's it, that all.

556
00:45:37.916 --> 00:45:40.375
In fact, I'd like

557
00:45:43.666 --> 00:45:45.041
to thank you, girl,

558
00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:48.958
because although you were little,

559
00:45:49.791 --> 00:45:52.750
you gave me a great gift.

560
00:45:52.833 --> 00:45:55.083
You chose me to be your family,

561
00:45:56.208 --> 00:45:57.791
part of your family.

562
00:45:59.625 --> 00:46:04.916
And I want to thank you too, darling,
because you never lost your faith in me.

563
00:46:06.666 --> 00:46:07.666
Thank you.

564
00:46:08.208 --> 00:46:09.333
And thank you.

565
00:46:09.416 --> 00:46:12.625
- And you too.
- My sincere gratitude.

566
00:46:12.708 --> 00:46:16.500
Cheers! Thank you all for being my family!

567
00:46:16.583 --> 00:46:19.458
Cheers!

568
00:46:19.541 --> 00:46:21.291
I got kind of emotional.

569
00:46:43.666 --> 00:46:45.625
- Hi. All good?
- Hi. Yes

570
00:46:45.708 --> 00:46:48.208
MEXICAN SWIMMING FEDERATION

571
00:46:48.291 --> 00:46:51.208
- From college or what?
- Yes, college.

572
00:46:52.125 --> 00:46:54.291
Yu-Gi-Oh! cards.

573
00:46:54.375 --> 00:46:57.500
- Bring the cards.
- All right.

574
00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:03.166
Come on!

575
00:47:05.083 --> 00:47:07.125
You can leave now! Good luck!

576
00:47:09.250 --> 00:47:12.916
I'll sit with Braulio now.
On the way back, I'll sit with you.

577
00:47:18.625 --> 00:47:20.125
- How are you?
- Good.

578
00:47:20.208 --> 00:47:22.500
- Excited?
- Yes, so excited.

579
00:47:30.583 --> 00:47:33.458
Your mother in law is after you!

580
00:47:33.541 --> 00:47:34.541
Bus driver.

581
00:47:34.583 --> 00:47:36.291
No, a cooler one!

582
00:47:36.375 --> 00:47:39.166
Three, two, one. Eggs with oil

583
00:47:39.250 --> 00:47:42.333
Eggs with oil

584
00:47:42.458 --> 00:47:45.375
Eggs with oil

585
00:47:45.458 --> 00:47:48.875
And ham

586
00:47:48.958 --> 00:47:52.125
How could you?

587
00:48:37.291 --> 00:48:39.041
They think engagement rings

588
00:48:39.125 --> 00:48:41.333
But I can only think of Olympic rings

589
00:49:03.500 --> 00:49:05.708
Welcome to Guadalajara!

590
00:49:06.458 --> 00:49:08.958
- We have the afternoon free!
- To the pool!

591
00:49:09.750 --> 00:49:12.500
Go to the pool.
I'll help with your homework.

592
00:49:12.583 --> 00:49:13.583
- Okay.
- Good.

593
00:49:16.083 --> 00:49:18.583
I can't believe it! Let's see this!

594
00:49:19.333 --> 00:49:20.958
Terrific, man.

595
00:49:22.333 --> 00:49:25.250
- Ask for ice!
- We already sent Alan!

596
00:49:27.083 --> 00:49:29.916
- Is this a joke?
- Nadia, to the second floor?

597
00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:32.958
Are you kidding? Go change!

598
00:49:33.041 --> 00:49:34.500
How's the water?

599
00:49:35.250 --> 00:49:36.250
Let's go, Mariel.

600
00:49:36.333 --> 00:49:39.875
The boys told me
the last one pays for the beer.

601
00:49:49.375 --> 00:49:51.000
This is so cool!

602
00:49:51.916 --> 00:49:53.333
I love it!

603
00:49:57.125 --> 00:49:59.416
- I want this bed.
- Sure.

604
00:50:01.333 --> 00:50:03.916
Braulio told me you've been here before.

605
00:50:04.375 --> 00:50:07.541
- Yes, we come almost every year.
- So cool.

606
00:50:08.125 --> 00:50:09.208
I love the hotel.

607
00:50:09.875 --> 00:50:13.875
We'll all be downstairs in the pool.
Are you coming?

608
00:50:14.833 --> 00:50:18.083
I think I'll stay here and rest.
I'm not feeling good.

609
00:50:18.708 --> 00:50:21.791
But this will be so cool,
we'll all be downstairs.

610
00:50:25.458 --> 00:50:26.500
How do I look?

611
00:50:28.666 --> 00:50:29.708
Very good.

612
00:50:31.541 --> 00:50:34.291
Let me know
in case you need anything, okay?

613
00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:38.291
Okay.

614
00:50:49.875 --> 00:50:53.083
- Nadia!
- Come here!

615
00:50:53.166 --> 00:50:55.041
Look!

616
00:50:55.125 --> 00:50:58.500
I didn't finish high school
and I'm a success.

617
00:50:58.583 --> 00:51:02.500
- Come here!
- No, we'll be studying.

618
00:51:05.333 --> 00:51:08.041
Don't listen to them.
You'll end up like that.

619
00:51:09.750 --> 00:51:10.791
I'm coming!

620
00:51:17.708 --> 00:51:18.708
Come here!

621
00:51:22.916 --> 00:51:26.708
Okay, so, where were we?

622
00:51:26.791 --> 00:51:29.958
We placed a bookmark. Here, perfect.

623
00:51:30.041 --> 00:51:32.000
Number two.

624
00:51:33.041 --> 00:51:34.666
"It is a geometric locus"

625
00:51:34.750 --> 00:51:38.125
formed by a set of points
that are at the same distance

626
00:51:38.208 --> 00:51:40.500
"from another fixed point, the center."

627
00:52:08.166 --> 00:52:12.666
Good evening. Do you have chamomile tea?

628
00:52:14.166 --> 00:52:18.000
Could you send a thermos
with hot water and lots of tea bags?

629
00:52:20.166 --> 00:52:21.166
Thank you.

630
00:52:43.291 --> 00:52:44.291
Hello?

631
00:52:46.875 --> 00:52:49.583
Hello, Irene. Nadia isn't here.

632
00:52:50.416 --> 00:52:51.833
They're all in the pool.

633
00:52:53.583 --> 00:52:57.250
Yes, the whole team.
I can tell her you called.

634
00:52:59.458 --> 00:53:00.458
Yes, it's okay.

635
00:53:01.291 --> 00:53:03.291
Yes, I'll let her know.

636
00:54:00.958 --> 00:54:01.958
Nadia.

637
00:54:04.541 --> 00:54:06.458
Your mom called.

638
00:54:07.625 --> 00:54:09.166
I'll call her back later.

639
00:54:10.375 --> 00:54:12.375
Calm down and drink some beer.

640
00:54:15.125 --> 00:54:16.750
Nadia, it's late. Let's go.

641
00:54:17.958 --> 00:54:21.041
We have to wake up early to train.
Come on.

642
00:54:21.541 --> 00:54:23.541
If you want, we can watch a movie.

643
00:54:24.916 --> 00:54:27.166
What's with you, girl?

644
00:54:27.250 --> 00:54:29.541
Do you want to steal my job as coach?

645
00:54:30.750 --> 00:54:31.875
Cut that!

646
00:54:31.958 --> 00:54:36.000
Don't you remember
you were just like her at her age?

647
00:54:36.083 --> 00:54:38.750
No one buys your goody-two-shoes act.

648
00:54:38.833 --> 00:54:42.291
Please, a beer for Sister Mariel!

649
00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:48.333
- Here, just one sip.
- I always remind you.

650
00:54:48.416 --> 00:54:49.416
Drink it!

651
00:54:50.750 --> 00:54:53.750
Apologies if I offended you, Mother!

652
00:54:54.708 --> 00:54:57.916
Apologies, Mother, if I offended you!

653
00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:06.000
Nadia?

654
00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:25.416
From Guadalajara, Luis Caballero
and Jesus Crespo Ruiz.

655
00:57:27.625 --> 00:57:31.000
You roll because you're going face down.
Keep it up.

656
00:57:31.083 --> 00:57:33.333
- Come on!
- Let's go!

657
00:57:33.416 --> 00:57:34.416
You can do it!

658
00:57:38.291 --> 00:57:39.375
Judges?

659
00:57:40.916 --> 00:57:45.041
Execution. Seven point five,
seven point five,

660
00:57:45.125 --> 00:57:47.666
seven, seven point five.

661
00:57:47.750 --> 00:57:51.500
Synchronization. Seven, seven point five,

662
00:57:51.583 --> 00:57:53.375
seven, seven.

663
00:57:54.375 --> 00:57:56.916
Thank you, judges. Thank you, competitors.

664
00:57:57.000 --> 00:58:01.583
Next, we'll begin
women's 10m synchronized diving.

665
00:58:01.666 --> 00:58:03.666
Approach straight up!

666
00:58:04.708 --> 00:58:05.791
Flex!

667
00:58:05.875 --> 00:58:09.583
One and a half turn
and front layout in position B.

668
00:58:15.875 --> 00:58:18.166
Nadia, are you okay?

669
00:58:20.791 --> 00:58:21.875
What happened?

670
00:58:23.083 --> 00:58:26.833
Not now, Mariel, please. Ready?

671
00:58:30.541 --> 00:58:31.583
Ready?

672
00:58:41.208 --> 00:58:42.541
Two, three.

673
00:58:45.708 --> 00:58:47.166
Two, three.

674
00:58:57.625 --> 00:58:58.750
Judges?

675
00:58:59.750 --> 00:59:04.041
Execution. Six point five, six point five,

676
00:59:04.125 --> 00:59:06.333
eight, eight.

677
00:59:06.416 --> 00:59:09.916
Synchronization. Five, six,

678
00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:12.416
five point five, five point five.

679
00:59:45.833 --> 00:59:47.750
Let's pack, we're leaving now.

680
00:59:48.875 --> 00:59:50.041
Let's pack!

681
00:59:52.833 --> 00:59:55.958
When you finish, go to my room.
I need to talk to you.

682
00:59:56.041 --> 00:59:57.041
Okay.

683
01:00:13.208 --> 01:00:14.458
Come in, it's open.

684
01:00:22.333 --> 01:00:23.750
Come in. Close the door.

685
01:00:31.041 --> 01:00:33.625
If you are going to get mad...

686
01:00:33.708 --> 01:00:36.958
What? Get mad?
You tell me how I should feel.

687
01:00:37.916 --> 01:00:40.416
I don't feel good.
I couldn't sleep at all.

688
01:00:40.500 --> 01:00:43.041
I think I have a fever.
I did my best.

689
01:00:43.125 --> 01:00:46.083
- I didn't mean to do that.
- Of course you did.

690
01:00:46.166 --> 01:00:49.250
You told me that you never
wanted to work with Nadia.

691
01:00:49.333 --> 01:00:53.541
No, I told you
I didn't want someone so young,

692
01:00:53.625 --> 01:00:56.166
and that these would be my last games.

693
01:00:56.250 --> 01:00:58.083
Look how things worked out now.

694
01:00:58.583 --> 01:01:02.250
Now, you're going
to your last games thanks to Nadia

695
01:01:02.333 --> 01:01:04.750
because what you did today was bullshit.

696
01:01:04.833 --> 01:01:07.083
You've been doing a shitty job lately.

697
01:01:07.875 --> 01:01:12.208
The level of difficulty of the dive
prevented you from being disqualified.

698
01:01:13.416 --> 01:01:16.625
Look, you're a talented girl.

699
01:01:16.708 --> 01:01:20.208
There's no doubt about it,
but you don't have guts.

700
01:01:21.125 --> 01:01:24.083
You made it through one Olympics.

701
01:01:24.166 --> 01:01:27.458
Only one. And what about the rest?

702
01:01:27.541 --> 01:01:30.250
You were disqualified
for a stupid mistake.

703
01:01:30.791 --> 01:01:35.458
And the rest?
You didn't even get on the plane, Mariel!

704
01:01:35.541 --> 01:01:38.583
You can't handle the pressure!

705
01:01:38.666 --> 01:01:42.541
If you want to sabotage yourself,
I'm sorry for you,

706
01:01:42.625 --> 01:01:44.750
but it's your choice, your decision.

707
01:01:45.416 --> 01:01:48.000
But you're ruining a little girl's chance

708
01:01:48.083 --> 01:01:52.125
who's just beginning because you're afraid
she'll do better than you.

709
01:01:52.208 --> 01:01:54.625
That's twisted, Mariel.

710
01:01:54.708 --> 01:01:58.875
I didn't mean to!
I've been sick several weeks.

711
01:01:58.958 --> 01:02:00.916
And why are you sick?

712
01:02:01.791 --> 01:02:05.708
Because you're fucking everyone again!

713
01:02:06.291 --> 01:02:07.416
That's why.

714
01:02:09.208 --> 01:02:10.416
What?

715
01:02:10.500 --> 01:02:14.291
You thought I wouldn't know
you fucked Carlos the other night?

716
01:02:15.083 --> 01:02:18.791
- Carlos was not supposed to...
- It wasn't Carlos. It wasn't him!

717
01:02:19.708 --> 01:02:24.208
Alicia told me you've got
the weird infection again.

718
01:02:25.541 --> 01:02:27.458
We all know everything, girl.

719
01:02:27.541 --> 01:02:32.000
And with you,
it's the same old story once and again.

720
01:02:32.083 --> 01:02:34.041
You can't stop fucking,

721
01:02:34.125 --> 01:02:39.041
as you can't stop screwing up your life
and the lives of those around you.

722
01:02:42.333 --> 01:02:45.125
The Federation wants to get rid of you.

723
01:02:46.708 --> 01:02:49.416
They say you're too old.

724
01:02:50.250 --> 01:02:52.833
But I asked them
to give you another chance.

725
01:02:52.916 --> 01:02:55.416
I said Nadia and you
were the perfect team,

726
01:02:55.500 --> 01:02:57.250
that there's nothing better.

727
01:02:57.333 --> 01:03:00.208
- Thank you.
- And you fucked it up today!

728
01:03:00.791 --> 01:03:05.375
- Help me, please!
- Please, don't cry.

729
01:03:05.458 --> 01:03:09.750
- I swear I can do it.
- Don't make a scene!

730
01:03:09.833 --> 01:03:13.541
- Forgive me, Braulio!
- Calm down, for goodness' sake.

731
01:03:13.625 --> 01:03:15.625
Go to the bathroom!

732
01:03:15.708 --> 01:03:18.041
- Wash your face and calm down!
- Sorry!

733
01:03:18.125 --> 01:03:20.916
- I don't want them to see you like this.
- Okay.

734
01:03:28.166 --> 01:03:29.250
Stupid girl!

735
01:03:32.083 --> 01:03:33.333
Stupid girl!

736
01:04:18.916 --> 01:04:20.000
Are you okay?

737
01:04:21.791 --> 01:04:22.791
Yes!

738
01:04:34.458 --> 01:04:36.500
- More at ease now?
- Yes.

739
01:04:38.208 --> 01:04:42.833
I need to rest a bit more.
I swear I won't fuck up anymore.

740
01:04:44.291 --> 01:04:45.291
I hope so, girl.

741
01:04:50.375 --> 01:04:51.375
Seriously.

742
01:04:53.125 --> 01:04:54.125
Yes.

743
01:05:31.125 --> 01:05:32.125
Nadia?

744
01:05:33.333 --> 01:05:36.375
I'm almost ready!
Tell them I won't take long!

745
01:05:37.750 --> 01:05:38.750
Okay!

746
01:05:50.125 --> 01:05:51.250
Let's go now!

747
01:06:00.666 --> 01:06:03.958
- Shall we go?
- Yes, I'll be right there.

748
01:06:52.750 --> 01:06:55.166
- My friend.
- You did it by a whisker.

749
01:06:55.250 --> 01:06:57.458
At least we qualified.

750
01:06:57.541 --> 01:06:59.791
- Daddy!
- Hi, honey!

751
01:06:59.875 --> 01:07:01.166
- Welcome.
- Thanks.

752
01:07:01.250 --> 01:07:02.083
Welcome.

753
01:07:02.166 --> 01:07:04.500
- I missed you so much!
- Me too.

754
01:07:04.583 --> 01:07:06.333
Welcome. Felix.

755
01:07:06.416 --> 01:07:07.541
Where's your mommy?

756
01:08:22.750 --> 01:08:25.500
I like having our secret.

757
01:08:28.791 --> 01:08:32.958
He asked if he could touch me.
That had never happened before.

758
01:08:36.250 --> 01:08:41.125
I couldn't speak because
he was kissing me so hard and when...

759
01:08:44.958 --> 01:08:47.083
he started touching my chest.

760
01:08:47.166 --> 01:08:49.166
He had never touched me there.

761
01:09:08.333 --> 01:09:10.166
I WANT TO SCREAM

762
01:09:15.916 --> 01:09:18.291
I would never do anything to hurt you.

763
01:09:21.250 --> 01:09:22.416
Easy, Mariel.

764
01:09:24.083 --> 01:09:25.458
You're burning up.

765
01:09:33.666 --> 01:09:35.208
He was kissing me so hard.

766
01:09:40.791 --> 01:09:43.000
Something started between us.

767
01:09:43.083 --> 01:09:45.375
No one else needs to know.

768
01:09:46.583 --> 01:09:49.541
Why don't you call the doctor, Gerardo?

769
01:10:04.500 --> 01:10:07.416
If the fever increases,
she has to go to the hospital.

770
01:10:11.541 --> 01:10:13.833
He told me he'd teach me how to feel.

771
01:10:32.583 --> 01:10:36.541
They say it's not a problem.
If she trains at least for two weeks...

772
01:10:36.625 --> 01:10:38.250
I know her, Braulio.

773
01:10:38.333 --> 01:10:40.458
Damn, Mariel! Fuck!

774
01:10:48.416 --> 01:10:51.791
I'd leave everything for you, Mariel.
I swear.

775
01:10:58.250 --> 01:11:00.708
Flex here.

776
01:11:01.875 --> 01:11:03.750
That's right!

777
01:11:03.833 --> 01:11:06.166
Long. Push the platform.

778
01:11:06.708 --> 01:11:07.708
Very good.

779
01:11:12.208 --> 01:11:13.541
Good, Mariel. Come on!

780
01:11:14.375 --> 01:11:16.333
Come on, stretch your leg.

781
01:11:22.500 --> 01:11:24.666
Push it in. That's right.

782
01:11:25.708 --> 01:11:27.250
Hard. That's right.

783
01:11:28.041 --> 01:11:29.916
Nadia is not training?

784
01:11:31.041 --> 01:11:32.583
Weren't we a team?

785
01:11:41.166 --> 01:11:45.541
Nadia has been working this whole time.
You're the one who has to catch up.

786
01:11:46.708 --> 01:11:51.833
Yes, but we're diving together,
and I have to train with her.

787
01:11:51.916 --> 01:11:56.000
No, honey, what you need is
to do what I tell you to, okay?

788
01:11:56.083 --> 01:12:00.666
- Braulio, I can...
- No. Who's the coach here? You?

789
01:12:02.250 --> 01:12:04.916
Mariel, will you tell us all what to do?

790
01:12:05.583 --> 01:12:07.833
Will you coach the team now?

791
01:12:08.541 --> 01:12:10.041
That's all I needed!

792
01:12:11.583 --> 01:12:15.250
I'm giving you a chance.
Don't push my buttons and get to work!

793
01:12:15.958 --> 01:12:19.583
No one is giving me a chance.
I'm here because I've earned it.

794
01:12:21.166 --> 01:12:22.166
Get down!

795
01:12:23.666 --> 01:12:26.083
Get down from the platform right now!

796
01:12:26.791 --> 01:12:29.458
Get down, Mariel!
I'm telling you to get down!

797
01:12:32.583 --> 01:12:34.708
All right! You're done.

798
01:12:35.208 --> 01:12:37.541
I came to train with my partner.

799
01:12:37.625 --> 01:12:40.458
- You're done for today.
- We're only weeks away...

800
01:12:40.541 --> 01:12:43.208
- Get out of the pool!
- from the Olympics!

801
01:12:43.291 --> 01:12:46.958
Get out right now or you'll be expelled!

802
01:12:47.041 --> 01:12:49.083
What do you say? Right now!

803
01:12:50.083 --> 01:12:51.166
Get out!

804
01:12:52.750 --> 01:12:54.625
And don't think of coming here

805
01:12:54.708 --> 01:12:58.166
if you're not willing
to follow my fucking orders!

806
01:13:34.750 --> 01:13:39.541
Would you like to eat anything?
Gerardo took your siblings to a game.

807
01:14:08.958 --> 01:14:11.833
- Are you okay, Yeya?
- Not now, Mom.

808
01:14:11.916 --> 01:14:13.500
What's going on, honey?

809
01:14:14.500 --> 01:14:16.125
Please, I want to be alone.

810
01:14:19.333 --> 01:14:20.875
What's going on, Mariel?

811
01:14:20.958 --> 01:14:22.916
I don't want to talk right now.

812
01:14:23.791 --> 01:14:29.083
We have to talk.
I won't let you do what you always do.

813
01:14:30.791 --> 01:14:34.166
What I always do?
What the fuck are you talking about?

814
01:14:34.250 --> 01:14:35.875
You're sabotaging yourself.

815
01:14:35.958 --> 01:14:39.916
The Olympic Games are near,
and you've become self-destructive.

816
01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:42.000
Where did you get that shit from?

817
01:14:42.625 --> 01:14:46.291
Braulio called this afternoon
and said you were out of control.

818
01:14:46.375 --> 01:14:48.666
Leave before anything happens.

819
01:14:48.750 --> 01:14:52.083
I'm not going anywhere
until you explain to me

820
01:14:52.166 --> 01:14:55.208
why you're destroying
everything you've built.

821
01:14:57.041 --> 01:15:00.250
- Stop it, for fuck's sake!
- Don't talk to me like that!

822
01:15:00.333 --> 01:15:02.958
You want to know
what's happening? All right!

823
01:15:10.166 --> 01:15:13.000
The great mystery
is that you were there, right?

824
01:15:13.666 --> 01:15:16.166
Every year, in every fucking tournament,

825
01:15:17.625 --> 01:15:19.250
you were there.

826
01:15:19.333 --> 01:15:24.000
Or he was here, because he's family,
because we're a fucking happy family.

827
01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:29.875
How could you not know, Mom?

828
01:15:35.666 --> 01:15:38.750
"Easy, girl, you rock here."

829
01:15:38.833 --> 01:15:42.500
"If you make a good dive,
"I'll make you feel real good."

830
01:15:42.583 --> 01:15:44.708
"I'll teach you how to be my woman."

831
01:15:45.291 --> 01:15:46.625
What's wrong with you?

832
01:15:46.708 --> 01:15:48.666
"You taste so good, girl."

833
01:15:48.750 --> 01:15:50.125
You're messed up.

834
01:15:51.250 --> 01:15:53.375
"You'll never find someone like me."

835
01:15:53.458 --> 01:15:56.083
How can you say something so appalling?

836
01:15:57.500 --> 01:16:00.500
- "I can't live without you, girl."
- You're so sick!

837
01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:06.458
Didn't you want to know
what was going on?

838
01:16:07.333 --> 01:16:09.041
That's what happened,

839
01:16:10.166 --> 01:16:12.958
right under your fucking nose,
the whole time.

840
01:16:19.250 --> 01:16:21.375
Why did you let me go to Monterrey?

841
01:16:24.541 --> 01:16:27.166
You were supposed to take care of me.

842
01:16:36.458 --> 01:16:37.500
Mom!

843
01:16:54.708 --> 01:16:56.125
You scared me to death!

844
01:16:57.125 --> 01:16:58.125
Sorry.

845
01:17:05.583 --> 01:17:08.250
- Nadia was worried too.
- Why?

846
01:17:09.333 --> 01:17:11.916
"Why?" You're a team, right?

847
01:17:15.250 --> 01:17:19.166
Are you ready to do team work
or are we still having issues?

848
01:17:19.250 --> 01:17:20.375
No issues.

849
01:17:22.750 --> 01:17:25.083
Stop, Braulio, let me go!

850
01:17:27.916 --> 01:17:31.833
I'll see you in 20 at the pool.
Everybody to the pool!

851
01:17:32.416 --> 01:17:36.791
Remember, arms, with strength!

852
01:17:36.875 --> 01:17:40.541
Approach straight up. Jump!

853
01:17:40.625 --> 01:17:41.916
Like that!

854
01:17:43.458 --> 01:17:44.708
Again!

855
01:17:46.083 --> 01:17:47.458
Again!

856
01:17:49.791 --> 01:17:52.791
Nadia, your face! That's right!

857
01:17:56.708 --> 01:17:59.500
Please, focus!

858
01:18:03.875 --> 01:18:08.000
You're not in sync, please!

859
01:18:14.458 --> 01:18:15.666
Push the platform.

860
01:18:15.750 --> 01:18:18.541
Rib tuck. Look for the water and flex.

861
01:18:21.125 --> 01:18:24.625
- Who told you to stop?
- Nadia is tired.

862
01:18:24.708 --> 01:18:26.208
Did I tell you to stop?

863
01:18:31.500 --> 01:18:34.791
Come on! We can't be doing this all day!

864
01:18:40.916 --> 01:18:43.458
Watch out! You were ahead.

865
01:18:44.125 --> 01:18:47.041
If you want to chat, go to a café!

866
01:18:51.291 --> 01:18:52.875
Arms! With strength!

867
01:18:55.166 --> 01:18:56.166
Again!

868
01:18:56.708 --> 01:18:57.750
You count.

869
01:19:03.041 --> 01:19:04.375
One, two.

870
01:19:12.750 --> 01:19:15.541
- Damn! That's worth the gold!
- Come on, team!

871
01:19:15.625 --> 01:19:19.916
Motherfucker! Excellent, I see gold now!

872
01:19:25.625 --> 01:19:29.375
Did you pack already?
I already packed mine.

873
01:19:29.458 --> 01:19:31.333
My dad says that's ridiculous,

874
01:19:31.416 --> 01:19:34.958
because me and my mom pack
two days before the trip

875
01:19:35.041 --> 01:19:36.708
so we don't forget anything.

876
01:19:37.416 --> 01:19:39.041
Do you think it'll be cold?

877
01:19:39.583 --> 01:19:42.958
- I searched on the Internet...
- I know about Braulio.

878
01:19:46.291 --> 01:19:48.083
I don't know what you mean.

879
01:19:49.708 --> 01:19:51.500
The same happened to me.

880
01:19:57.250 --> 01:19:58.250
Nadia.

881
01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:08.000
Nadia, please, let me help you.

882
01:20:08.083 --> 01:20:09.625
I don't need your help.

883
01:20:12.250 --> 01:20:13.791
What he's doing is wrong.

884
01:20:14.750 --> 01:20:18.041
He's our coach. He's an adult.
And you're a little girl.

885
01:20:19.583 --> 01:20:20.916
I'm not a little girl.

886
01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:25.166
You're 14, I was your same age.
But I was all alone, and you are not.

887
01:20:25.250 --> 01:20:29.166
- You don't get what happens between us.
- I perfectly get it.

888
01:20:30.125 --> 01:20:32.416
He's telling you that you rock,

889
01:20:32.500 --> 01:20:35.291
that you're special
and there's no one like you,

890
01:20:35.375 --> 01:20:38.291
that you must keep the secret
because they won't get it.

891
01:20:38.375 --> 01:20:40.875
I perfectly know what he's telling you.

892
01:20:40.958 --> 01:20:44.541
Braulio was right.
He said you'd try to screw everything up.

893
01:20:44.625 --> 01:20:47.500
You're so damn jealous! I don't care!

894
01:20:47.583 --> 01:20:50.916
Back from Greece,
we'll get married and he'll be with me.

895
01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:52.333
He's leaving his wife.

896
01:21:19.166 --> 01:21:20.166
What happened?

897
01:21:21.791 --> 01:21:23.333
You have to take a shower.

898
01:21:24.375 --> 01:21:26.291
Today's the press conference.

899
01:21:31.083 --> 01:21:32.500
Braulio came to see you.

900
01:21:34.666 --> 01:21:35.666
He's downstairs.

901
01:21:37.958 --> 01:21:39.375
He wants to talk to you.

902
01:21:41.958 --> 01:21:43.208
He called last night.

903
01:21:44.958 --> 01:21:47.583
I think you need
to apologize to him, Mariel.

904
01:21:51.833 --> 01:21:53.500
We're so close, honey.

905
01:22:23.125 --> 01:22:25.625
- If you came to threaten me...
- No, Mariel.

906
01:22:27.833 --> 01:22:29.208
I came to apologize.

907
01:22:34.500 --> 01:22:35.500
Forgive me.

908
01:22:40.958 --> 01:22:42.291
Forgive me, please.

909
01:22:44.791 --> 01:22:46.625
I was so confused.

910
01:22:48.791 --> 01:22:50.208
And now I realize

911
01:22:52.083 --> 01:22:54.250
that I've become a monster.

912
01:22:59.083 --> 01:23:00.666
I am a human being

913
01:23:02.541 --> 01:23:05.000
with flaws and weaknesses,

914
01:23:07.208 --> 01:23:10.708
but I don't want that to justify
all the damage I've done,

915
01:23:12.291 --> 01:23:13.708
especially to you, girl.

916
01:23:15.041 --> 01:23:16.416
Forgive me, please.

917
01:23:19.708 --> 01:23:21.041
You're Mariel.

918
01:23:21.916 --> 01:23:23.166
My Mariel.

919
01:23:26.041 --> 01:23:29.083
We had a very special relationship, girl.

920
01:23:32.708 --> 01:23:34.000
And I miss it.

921
01:23:34.875 --> 01:23:36.250
I miss it so much.

922
01:23:38.041 --> 01:23:39.375
I need you.

923
01:23:40.041 --> 01:23:42.083
And I know you need me too.

924
01:23:44.791 --> 01:23:46.875
You and I are meant for each other.

925
01:23:48.291 --> 01:23:49.291
Please.

926
01:23:52.041 --> 01:23:54.166
Let's give ourselves another chance.

927
01:23:58.125 --> 01:23:59.750
We have to be together.

928
01:24:00.708 --> 01:24:02.666
Don't you ever touch me again...

929
01:24:06.875 --> 01:24:08.250
in your fucking life.

930
01:24:13.250 --> 01:24:14.791
Don't ever touch me again.

931
01:24:22.791 --> 01:24:24.166
Do you want your medal?

932
01:24:27.208 --> 01:24:29.291
Don't you dare touch her.

933
01:24:31.791 --> 01:24:37.041
If you get close to her again,
I'll tell everything to everyone.

934
01:24:39.750 --> 01:24:42.875
I don't give a fuck
if my life goes down with yours.

935
01:24:48.208 --> 01:24:49.208
I mean it.

936
01:24:59.083 --> 01:25:01.625
We want to honor these athletes

937
01:25:01.708 --> 01:25:04.875
who are traveling to Greece tomorrow

938
01:25:04.958 --> 01:25:10.875
to represent Mexico
in the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens.

939
01:25:10.958 --> 01:25:12.958
A round of applause, please!

940
01:25:13.041 --> 01:25:14.875
Bravo!

941
01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:27.500
We're very proud to represent our country.

942
01:25:29.791 --> 01:25:32.000
- My pleasure.
- Good luck, Mariel.

943
01:25:32.083 --> 01:25:35.333
All right, kids, it's time! Let's go!

944
01:25:36.458 --> 01:25:38.333
I'm so proud of you, honey.

945
01:25:38.916 --> 01:25:40.125
Let's go, kids!

946
01:25:41.625 --> 01:25:45.458
Mexico!

947
01:25:56.583 --> 01:25:57.583
Irene.

948
01:26:02.791 --> 01:26:03.958
Forgive me.

949
01:27:25.625 --> 01:27:28.375
From Greece, Eftihia Pappa

950
01:27:29.666 --> 01:27:31.708
and Florentia Sfakianou.

951
01:27:32.583 --> 01:27:35.666
From Mexico, Mariel Saenz

952
01:27:36.541 --> 01:27:38.500
and Nadia Alfaro.

953
01:27:53.958 --> 01:27:58.208
Mariel has achieved the best performance
in her whole career.

954
01:27:58.291 --> 01:28:00.333
We'll see the Mexican duet.

955
01:28:00.416 --> 01:28:05.416
A brilliant duet formed
by expertise and youth.

956
01:28:05.500 --> 01:28:08.875
They'll perform the last dive.

957
01:28:09.500 --> 01:28:13.166
A dive with a great level of difficulty.

958
01:28:13.250 --> 01:28:16.625
They already dominate this technique,

959
01:28:16.708 --> 01:28:19.833
despite the short time
they've been training together.

960
01:28:19.916 --> 01:28:22.333
It's the last dive of the competition.

961
01:28:22.416 --> 01:28:25.291
All Mexico's watching what could be

962
01:28:25.375 --> 01:28:29.208
the first medal
for the Mexican Olympic Team.

963
01:28:30.208 --> 01:28:32.500
I WANT TO SCREAM

964
01:28:46.125 --> 01:28:49.000
I'd have liked to do something before,

965
01:28:49.083 --> 01:28:50.416
but I couldn't.

966
01:29:11.916 --> 01:29:14.291
What? How? This can't be true!

967
01:29:14.416 --> 01:29:17.708
This is really extraordinary!

968
01:29:21.791 --> 01:29:24.458
It doesn't seem to be an injury,

969
01:29:24.541 --> 01:29:26.958
but something must have happened

970
01:29:27.041 --> 01:29:30.083
because Mexico is leaving
without its medal.

971
01:29:36.375 --> 01:29:40.000
Braulio Peralta told me
he'd never met anyone like me,

972
01:29:40.083 --> 01:29:42.916
something that surely
he also told your daughter.

973
01:29:43.916 --> 01:29:46.333
If it hadn't been for Nadia,

974
01:29:46.416 --> 01:29:49.583
I might never have woken up
from this nightmare.

975
01:29:50.875 --> 01:29:53.750
The only thing I can give her
is the truth,

976
01:29:54.833 --> 01:29:59.041
and hope she can run away
before this hell consumes her alive.

977
01:33:15.250 --> 01:33:20.750
